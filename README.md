CardSite combines two things, a business card and a personal site, into one. A unique take on the traditional business card and personal site, it is created in HTML/CSS. The project entails abundant use of SVGs, CSS animations, and CSS grids.

## Features
* #### CSS animations create a dynamic and visually impressive product
* #### Working icons, allowing for calls, emails, and visits to Github or LinkedIn on click
* #### Fully resonsive design works on cell phones
* #### Scannable QR code redirects the user to the launch url

## Requirements
* Node ```v10.13.1```

## Run CardSite locally:
1. Clone github repo

2. Install the dependencies and packages:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  
 3. Activate the webpack:
 ```
 npm start
 ```
 
 4. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser
 
 ## About the Project
CardSite was designed and built over the course of two days. A wireframe was drawn out to visually plan the card and its layout before coding began. Once the project was underway, I utilized multiple CodePen tutorials for gudiance about SVGs and CSS animations. Responsivness was achieved through foregoing the hardcoding of pixel values for width, height, margins, etc.

## The Technology
CardSite is created in plain HTML/CSS.
